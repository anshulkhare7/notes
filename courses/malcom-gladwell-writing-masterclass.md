## ''Structuring Narrative''

### A. Imperfect Puzzle<br>
The best narrative is an imperfect puzzle. Don’t complete it for the reader. Best arguments are imperfect. Obvious analogies don’t draw the reader. Imperfect analogies do. Imperfect puzzles leave people talking about it. Their brains get stuck in those imperfect puzzles. The stickiness factor is high. 

### B. Leave it Messy<br>
Being interesting is more important than being complete. Don’t keep all the promises that you make to the reader. 

### C. Incomplete Story<br>
Sometime the reader is so involved in your narrative that he/she gets emotionally invested in the story and wants to know how it ends. And when you leave the story unfinished, the reader remembers it for a long time precisely because it haunts them. Anti-climax is a powerful trick for creating award winning movies/screenplays. 

Another way to do this is to attract the attention of the reader by presenting a tough problem. Then you describe something interesting and connect it to the tough problem without really giving a solution to the problem. 

### D. Number the Sections<br>
This way you don't have to explain the reader that you are transitioning from one thought to another. You can always connect those two thoughts later by referring to the sections. This eases the task of building a logical flow in your narrative.

## ''Holding Readers''

### A. Tools for Engagement<br>

* Give your readers cognitive tools. Something that reader isn't familiar with — it could be an idea you made up — and then the reader would want to use that tool. It will keep him going. While you explain your tool, go slow. Break it down. Don't throw complex data at once. One row, one column, one part of the chart at a time. 
* You need two things to give your readers — a ''Candy'' and a ''Meal''. 
* Meal is that part of your work which readers think about, chew, and take back home. 
* Candy helps your readers sell your work. Your readers can't express your ideas to others (their friends) in short conversations. They need something from your writing which they can easily express/talk about to others during a conversation. This is Candy which will be passed by your audience to others who in turn will come for the Meal. The Candy could be a digression from your main topic. It could be an interesting Trivia.

### B. Controlling Information<br>

## ''Drafts and Revisions''

* Set a reasonable bar. You can't write a lot in a day. It's mentally draining. A few paras a day is pretty good.
* 

## ''After Your Work is Published''

* Let go off your ideas. Once you've published something, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to your readers. You can't police what your readers do with your ideas. They might misinterpret it. Control the urge to go out and correct the people unless it's creating a risk for you.
* Promote your work. Talk about it.
* Learn from your reviews. If you feel you've been treated unfairly by your critics, chances are that most readers will feel the same.  

## ''Working as a Writer''

* Don't always try to be better because that's hard. Try to be different.
* Write interesting pieces. If you write interesting things, the system will find you. World is pretty good at discovering talent.
* Get a job to support your passion. Job will relieve you from the economic burden of your passion.
* Draw from your accumulated knowledge.

## ''How to Read''

* Read to discover intent.
* Learn to appreciate
* Supply context to what you read.
* Reconstruct a writer's thought process. Chase the references that writer used and read them. It will reveal how the writer built the narrative.

## ''Who to Read''

* Every profession has people who are revered by the insiders and not by the outsiders. Musician's musician. Architect's architect.
* Gladwell recommends — Lee Child, Michael Lewis, David Epstein.
